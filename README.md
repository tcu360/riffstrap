Riffstrap
=========

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

Riffstrap is TCU 360's customized version of Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Most of the customizations are within the LESS files provided by Bootstrap, which allow variables to be overriden across all of the project's CSS.

In addition to Bootstrap, this repository contains FontAwesome icons and a custom icon set generated using [FontCustom](http://fontcustom.com/). That font can be updated by adding SVG files to the `fontcustom/svg` directory and can be compiled by running `fontcustom compile`. Using the font, the TCU 360 logo can be printed using:

```html
<span class="icon-custom-logo-parts colorized">
	<i class="icon-custom-logo-riff"></i>
	<i class="icon-custom-logo-tcu"></i>
	<i class="icon-custom-logo-360"></i>
	<i class="icon-custom-logo-alltcu"></i>
</span>
```

## Performance

Because this is a one-size-fits-all solution there's probably some extra stuff that can be trimmed to reduce the amount of stuff bundled with this app. Here are a few places you may want to trim:

####Bootstrap
**CSS:** Bootstrap's default build has styles in it for every one of Bootstrap's many [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/). In Riffstrap, what is included in Bootstrap's build is set by [`/src/custom-bootstrap/bootstrap.less`](https://github.com/tcu360/riffstrap/blob/master/src/custom-bootstrap/bootstrap.less). For example, we don't use Bootstrap's built-in [glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons) (we use [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) instead), so `glyphicons.less` is commented out:

```css
// Reset and dependencies
@import "normalize.less";
@import "print.less";
/*@import "glyphicons.less";*/
```

You can do the same for any of Bootstrap's many components that you're not using. This can substantially decrease the amount of CSS generated by Bootstrap.

**JavaScript:** Bootstrap comes with a pretty extensive library of JavaScript components for everything from [modal boxes](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals) to [tooltips](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips). Chances are you're not using all of them, but by default they're all included here. The easiest way to trim that down is by stopping Grunt from mixing them in with your app's `script.js` file. At the top of [`Gruntfile.js`](https://github.com/tcu360/riffstrap/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) there's a `scripts` array that probably looks something like this:

```javascript
var scripts = [
	'bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js',
	'bower_components/bootstrap/js/**.js',
	'src/script.js'
];
```

The line that says `bower_components/bootstrap/js/**.js` is telling Grunt to mix every file in Bootstrap's JavaScript folder into your app's `script.js`. You can delete that line and instead only list the scripts you want. For example, if you were using modals and no other JavaScript components, you could change the above to:

```javascript
var scripts = [
	'bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js',
	'bower_components/bootstrap/js/modal.js',
	'bower_components/bootstrap/js/transition.js',
	'src/script.js'
];
```

Our JavaScript now only includes the Bootstrap plug-ins for modal boxes and transitions (used by the modal boxes). That reduced the size of our JavaScript by about 1,300 lines.

Also keep in mind that if you're not using any of Bootstrap's JavaScript functionality that you can exclude it entirely from your build without any negative effects.

####Web fonts
The Lato font, loaded from the Google Fonts API in the `<head>` of the main `index.html` file, loads all varieties of the Lato font. You're likely not using all of them and can drop the ones you don't need. Google has [a tool](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Lato) that can help with that, but you can also just drop them from the URL in `index.html`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100,300,400,700,900,100italic,300italic,400italic,700italic,900italic">
```
